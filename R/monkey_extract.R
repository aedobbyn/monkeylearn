#' monkey_extract
#'
#' Independent extractions for each row of a dataframe using the Monkeylearn extractor modules
#'
#' @param input A dataframe or vector of texts (each text smaller than 50kB)
#'
#' @param col If input is a dataframe, the unquoted name of the character column containing text to extract from
#' @param key The API key
#' @param extractor_id The ID of the extractor
#' @param params Parameters for the module as a named list.
#' @param texts_per_req Number of texts to be processed per requests. Minimum value is the number of texts in input; max is 200, as per
#' [Monkeylearn documentation](docs.monkeylearn.com/article/api-reference/). If NULL, we default to 200, or, if there are fewer than 200 texts, the length of the input.
#' @param unnest Should the output column be unnested?
#' @param verbose Whether to output messages about batch requests and progress of processing.
#'
#' @details Find IDs of extractors using \url{https://app.monkeylearn.com/main/explore}.
#'
#' This function relates the rows in your original dataframe or elements in your vector to an extraction particular to that row.
#' This allows you to know which row of your original dataframe is associated with which extraction.
#' Each row of the dataframe is extracted separately from all of the others, but the number of extractions a particular input row
#' is assigned may vary (unless you specify a fixed number of outputs in \code{params}).
#'
#' The \code{texts_per_req} parameter simply specifies the number of rows to feed the API at a time; it does not lump these together
#' for extraction as a group. Varying this parameter does not affect the final output, but does affect speed: one batched request of
#' x texts is faster than x single-text requests:
#' \url{http://help.monkeylearn.com/frequently-asked-questions/queries/can-i-classify-or-extract-more-than-one-text-with-one-api-request}.
#' Even if batched, each text still counts as one query, so batching does not save you on hits to the API.
#' See the [Monkeylearn API docs](docs.monkeylearn.com/article/api-reference/) for more details.
#'
#' You can check the number of calls you can still make in the API using \code{attr(output, "headers")$x.query.limit.remaining}
#' and \code{attr(output, "headers")$x.query.limit.limit}.

#' recruits that Wall Street, not Silicon Valley, was the place to be for computer
#' scientists.\n\n The Goldman employees knew they had an uphill battle. They were

#'  Silicon Valley as the promised land of flip-flops, beanbag chairs and million-dollar
#'   stock options.\n\n Their argument to the room of technologically inclined students

#' Within the free plan, you can make up to 20 requests per minute.
#'
#' You can use batch to send up to 200 texts to be analyzed within the API
#' (classification or extraction) with each request.
#' So for example, if you need to analyze 6000 tweets,
#' instead of doing 6000 requests to the API, you can use batch to send 30 requests,
#' each request with 200 tweets.
#' The function automatically makes these batch calls and waits if there is a throttle limit error,
#' but you might want to control the process yourself using several calls to the function.
#'
#' You can check the number of calls you can still make in the API using \code{attr(output, "headers")$x.query.limit.remaining}
#' and \code{attr(output, "headers")$x.query.limit.limit}.
#'
#' @return A data.frame (tibble) with the cleaned input (empty strings removed) and a new column, nested by default, containing the extraction for that particular row.
#' Attribute is a data.frame (tibble) "headers" including the number of remaining queries as "x.query.limit.remaining".
